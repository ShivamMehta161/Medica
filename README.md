## Problem Statement


The rapid advancement of AI in healthcare presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in addressing critical issues such as pandemic response, breast cancer classification, and mental health care. With the global COVID-19 pandemic serving as a stark reminder of the urgent need for effective healthcare solutions, the utilization of AI in tasks like contact tracing and drug discovery has demonstrated promise.

Additionally, mental health disorders represent a growing burden, with underdiagnosis and undertreatment contributing to disparities in access to care. AI and ML technologies hold promise in improving mental health care delivery, but challenges like data privacy and algorithmic biases underscore the need for responsible and equitable implementation (source: World Health Organization).
The urgency to address these challenges is clear, with lives and well-being at stake.

Collaborative efforts between healthcare professionals, researchers, policymakers, and technology developers are essential to overcome barriers and harness the full potential of AI and ML in healthcare delivery. By prioritizing ethically sound and clinically effective solutions, we can strive towards a future where healthcare is more accessible, equitable, and effective for all individuals, regardless of their medical condition or socioeconomic status.










## Why Does the Problem Exist?
The persistence of challenges in healthcare, such as inaccurate diagnosis, delayed treatment, and disparities in access to care, stems from various factors. Limited resources, fragmented healthcare systems, and outdated practices contribute to inefficiencies and gaps in patient care. Additionally, the complexity and volume of healthcare data pose challenges for traditional methods of analysis and decision-making. Furthermore, societal factors such as stigma surrounding mental health and disparities in healthcare access exacerbate the problem. Without effective solutions, these issues continue to impact patient outcomes and strain healthcare systems globally. Thus, the urgency to leverage AI and ML technologies to address these challenges arises from the pressing need for more accurate, efficient, and equitable healthcare delivery.
